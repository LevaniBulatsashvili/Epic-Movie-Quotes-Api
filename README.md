## Getting Started

1. First of all you need to clone Epic-Movie-Quotes-Api repository from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/levan-bulatsashvili-epic-movie-quotes-api
```

2. Next step requires you to run composer install in order to install all the dependencies.

```
composer install
```

3. after you have installed all the PHP dependencies, it's time to install all the JS dependencies:

```
npm install
```

and also:

```
npm run build
```

in order to build your JS/CSS resources.

4. Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

And now you should provide .env file all the necessary environment variables:

---

## MYSQL:

> PUSHER_APP_ID=**\***

> PUSHER_APP_KEY=**\***

> PUSHER_APP_SECRET=**\***

> FRONTEND_URL =**\***

> PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=**\***

> GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=**\***

> GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=**\***

> FULL_FRONTEND_URL=**\***

> FRONTEND_URL =**\***

> GOOGLE_REDIRECT=**\***

> DB_PASSWORD=**\***

> JWT_SECRET=**\***

after setting up .env file, execute:

```
php artisan config:cache
```

in order to cache environment variables.

sometimes .env file doesn't save properly, in that case run:

```
php artisan optimize:clear
```

to optimize the cache.

5. We also need to create public storage link

```
php artisan storage:link
```

6. Now execute in the root of you project following:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

Which generates auth key.

## Migrations

if you've completed getting started section, then migrating database if fairly simple process, just execute:

```
php artisan migrate
```

## Development

finally:

run Laravel's built-in development server by executing:

```
php artisan serve
```
